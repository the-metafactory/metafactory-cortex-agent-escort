# Lifecycle postinstall step 1: the running cortex daemon learns about the
# freshly dropped agents.d/escort.yaml fragment.
#
# Ordering invariant: reload FIRST — the daemon must register the agent before
# any later step acts on it. (There is no creds-issue step in this pack: the
# escort is in-process, riding the stack's signing identity — see
# arc-manifest.yaml.)
#
# Tolerant: no cortex on PATH or no running daemon is a soft skip (fresh
# machine; the principal boots cortex later and the fragment is picked up at
# boot), but a cortex that IS present and fails the reload is a real error.
